# Time Complexiy Analysis in C++
## A comprehensive defination of Big Oh

**"Big O describes how an algorithm's runtime or space grows as the input size increases. It helps us compare algorithms and predict performance at scale."**

While analyzing a particular algorithm, we usually count the number of operations
performed by the algorithm. We focus on the number of operations, not on the actual computer time to execute the algorithm. This is because a particular algorithm can be implemented on a variety of computers and the speed of the computer can affect the execution time. However, the number of operations performed by the algorithm would be the same on each computer.
