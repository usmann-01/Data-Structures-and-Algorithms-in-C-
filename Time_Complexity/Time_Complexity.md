# Time Complexiy Analysis in C++
## A comprehensive defination of Big Oh

**"Big O describes how an algorithm's runtime or space grows as the input size increases. It helps us compare algorithms and predict performance at scale."**

While analyzing a particular algorithm(a set of instructions that is designed to accomplish a task), we usually count the number of operations performed by the algorithm. We focus on the number of operations, not on the actual computer time to execute the algorithm. This is because a particular algorithm can be implemented on a variety of computers and the speed of the computer can affect the execution time. However, the number of operations performed by the algorithm would be the same on each computer.
